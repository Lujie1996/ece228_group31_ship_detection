#### Final Project: Detecting Ship Location and Heading in Satellite Images ####

Group members: Jie Lu, Junchao Lin, Ge Lu, Haocheng Zhu

Group number: 31

#### About this repo: ####

*Traditional_ml.ipynb* shows how the traditional ML models works in classifying ship/non-ship images.

*BasicCNN.ipynb* shows how we designed the basic CNN model using keras. It has has test code to run the detection.

*Final.ipynb* is based on BasicCNN.ipynb and added ship heading detection. 

(Both the three files relie on 'shipsnet.json' as dataset to train the model, and relie basicCNN_test.png and test.pbg repectively to show the demo)
